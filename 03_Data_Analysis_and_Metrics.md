## Data Analysis & Metrics Logic

### Data Preparation
- Reviewed and standardised employee master data
- Validated key fields such as department, role, tenure, and performance ratings
- Ensured data consistency for accurate analysis

### Metrics & Calculations
- Attrition Rate = Employees exited / Average headcount
- Average Tenure calculated by role and department
- Performance distribution analysed across rating bands
- High-risk segments identified using tenure and performance indicators

### Analytical Approach
- Trend analysis across time and departments
- Comparative analysis between high- and low-performing teams
- Focus on actionable insights rather than raw data outputs
